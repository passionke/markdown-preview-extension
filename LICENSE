GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\nBoston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the software and to share adaptations of it.\n} to make sure you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are assured that you will be treated fairly if you distribute the software.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nTherefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the wishes of others who distribute it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n\n1. TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductors.\n"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\nEach licensee is addressed as "you".\n"Licensees" refer to individuals or entities that receive a license from the Licensor.\n"Licensor" means the individual or legal entity that offers the Program under the terms of this License.\n\n\n2. Basic Permissions\n\nYou may not use the Program unless you accept this License. Each time you redistribute the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original Licensor to use the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n\n3. Source Code\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.\nFor example, if the Program is a compiler or assembler, the source code is the complete program, while an object code is the output of a source code compilation, such as the resulting software that can be executed.\nIf you have received the Program as a compiled executable program or as a complete installation package for the Program, you must make it available under the same terms as this License.\n\n\n4. Modification\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it. In this case, it is your responsibility to ensure that you clearly mark the changes you make, and to include the copyright notice when you distribute the altered Program.\n\n\n5. Copyleft\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Program, and you may modify your copy or copies of the Program under the terms of this License.\nThere are however some limitations to this. You may place a license on the derived work that takes away some rights of the user. But to keep the freedom and fairness, you need to give the user of your derived work at least the same rights you received when you got that work from the Licensor.\n\n\n6. Distribution\n\nYou must distribute the Program or modified versions of it in a way that allows others to receive the source code.\nThis means that when you distribute the Program, you must either provide access to the source code, or follow the conditions for distribution mentioned in this License. You must also show recipients a copy of this License with every distribution.\n\n\n7. Accepting a Warranty\n\nThere is no warranty for the software. If you distribute the software in any form, you must include a notice stating that there is no warranty for this software. Any implied warranties are also disclaimed.\n\n\n8. Withdrawal\n\nIf you violate this License, your rights are terminated automatically.\n\n\n9. Termination\n\nThere are important differences between this License and others. Some licenses allow the Licensor to terminate your rights under the License if you violate its terms.\nUnder this License, if you do not change the software in a way that breaks your rights, you cannot lose your rights. However, if you do violate the terms of this License, you may lose your rights until or unless this License is reinstated.\n\n\n10. Accepting the License\n\nYou accept this License if you copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, or sell copies of the Program.\n\n\n11. Future Versions\n\nYou may also elect to follow the terms of future versions of the GNU General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the License. In that case, the relevant version of the License will apply for your rights.\n\n\n12. Other Intended Licenses\n\nThe license does not limit your rights under the additional licenses you might agree to. This License only comes into effect when you include the GPL license text in your program.\n\n\n13. What is Not Covered\n\nThis License does not provide warranties of any kind.\n\n\n14. Legal Enforcement\n\nThis License is intended to be a legally binding contract, but applicable licenses and regulations may differ in different jurisdictions.\n\n\n15. Conclusion\n\nIf you have further questions or complications regarding this License, please contact the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nEnd of Terms and Conditions
